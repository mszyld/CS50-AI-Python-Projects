# CS50-AI-Python-Projects
My projects for Harvard's CS50 AI course

- 0a. Degrees: a program that determines how many “degrees of separation” apart two actors are.
- 0b. Tictactoe: an AI that plays Tic-Tac-Toe optimally using Minimax with alpha-beta pruning.
- 1a. Knights: a program that solves logic [Knights and Knaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_and_Knaves) puzzles.
- 1b. Minesweeper: an AI that plays Minesweeper making logical deductions.
- 2a. PageRank: an AI that ranks web pages by importance both by sampling pages from a Markov Chain random surfer and by iteratively applying the PageRank formula.
- 2b. Heredity: an AI that assesses the likelihood that a person will have a particular genetic trait using a Bayesian Network.
- 3a. Crossword: an AI that generates crossword puzzles using backtracking search and the minimum remaining value and least-constraining values heuristics.
- 4a. Shopping: an AI that predicts whether online shopping customers will complete a purchase, with good sensitivity and specificity, using a nearest-neighbor classifier model.
- 4b. Nim: an AI that teaches itself to play [Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim) through reinforcement learning.
- 5a. Traffic: an AI that identifies with >95% accuracy which of the 43 categories matches that of a traffic sign in a photograph, by training a neural network on the [GTSRB](https://www.google.com/search?q=GTSRB) dataset.
- 6a. Parser: an AI that parses sentences and extracts noun phrases using Natural Language Toolkit package NLTK.
- 6b. Questions: in progress.
